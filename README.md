# emo

**Emo** is an educational project that aims to improve programmers'
understanding of the machine by creating a RISC CPU emulator that resembles real
life processors. Emo is implemented in Go and compiles to WASM so that users can
access and manipulate its state using JavaScript.

Once that is achieved, a Web UI is going to be developed to add the visual
component to this learning experience.
